<p class="text-center" style="color: rgb(156, 156, 156); font-size: 20px"><b>Astrology</b> is a glorious and beautiful harmonization of stars where nothing can be hidden under the heavens. It’s a priceless treasure which helps us to create our own reality more consciously. </p>
<p class="text-center" style="color: rgb(156, 156, 156); font-size: 20px">Celestial bodies, just like the sun, the moon, the planets or stars configurations during our birth, indicates, influence and determines the basic biography inclinations, characteristics, strengths and weaknesses by their various unique configurations. Particular combination and placements  of these celestial bodies in the natal chart of the querent during birth time dictates ones life’s course and also the kind of prospects they will have. They have an influence throughout the life of a human being, and these planetary influences are the "fruit of karma". </p>

<p class="text-center" style="color: rgb(156, 156, 156); font-size: 20px">Our Consultations consist of an overview of the birth chart with a focus on achieving one’s purpose in life and helps in providing tremendous clarity on all matters of love, family, health, career, finance, education. Your astrological chart may indicate that you are experiencing a positive time to increase your resources or that you need to take greater care in high risk situations, but the exact circumstances and outcome are not determined by your chart. These planetary archetypes do not work alone … they are all part. They are the hidden energies of your birth chart and are part of a whole, that whole is YOU
As a result this is helping you understand YOU. </p>

<p class="text-center" style="color: rgb(156, 156, 156); font-size: 20px">Also an astrologer should not make decisions for you! You can use astrology to help you make the best determinations, but you must make the decisions and take actions yourself. Astrological forecasting is like a weather forecast. It will indicate may be that there will be rain tomorrow, but whether or not to take an umbrella in the rain getting soaked is up to you!</p>

<p class="text-center" style="color: rgb(156, 156, 156); font-size: 20px">We Help you to deal with blockages in your life and thus move forward with greater confidence and empowerment </p>

<p></p>
<p class="text-center" style="color: rgb(156, 156, 156); font-size: 20px">The zodiac signs represent “How” as in how the energy is expressed.  The houses of the zodiac represent the “Where” as in the areas of  life the energy will play out.Think about the planets not as inanimate objects in the sky, but rather as archetypal energy.  Think of them as actors on a stage where the play just happens to be your life. Think of your neighbourhood, your family, your friends.  How do they treat each other, what are they saying, who speaks to whom and how, who gets on and who doesn’t.  Thinking like this helps make your astrology chart come alive.</p>
<p class="text-center" style="color: rgb(156, 156, 156); font-size: 20px">Each planet and each zodiac sign has its own mythology.  When thinking of astrology, I always encourage people to think of nature, of the cycles of nature, imagine the planets … how they look, consider the mythology behind their planetary names.  Think of the mythologies attached to the zodiac.  In short … ALWAYS TRY TO THINK OF ASTROLOGY VISUALLY.</p>

<p class="text-center" style="color: rgb(156, 156, 156); font-size: 20px">Most of us know our Sun Sign and leave it at that.  While our sun sign is indeed important given that the archetype of the Sun is to show us where we shine in our lives … or our Spirit … there is so much more to consider.  As an example, Mars represents our drive and motivation; Venus is our desire; Mercury is how we learn and communicate; The Moon is about our past and our emotions; Jupiter shows us where in our lives we wish to expand and grow … and so on.</p>
<p class="text-center" style="color: rgb(156, 156, 156); font-size: 20px">A conceptual understanding of the celestial influence on your life will assist you to take action to ensure the most effective outcomes for your efforts.</p>
