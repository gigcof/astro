  <p class="text-center" style="color: rgb(156, 156, 156); font-size: 20px"> <b>Vaastu Shastra</b> is an ancient Indian science developed thousands of years ago by Indian sages. It lays down rules for the construction of buildings and temples and has been practiced for centuries. Vaastu shastra principles create a place full of harmony by taking advantage of five elements of the nature thereby showing way to enhance health, happiness and prosperity. We can use special characteristics of five elements and universal influences such as gravitational effect, magnetic field, light and heat of the sun etc. to plan, construct and renovate dwelling places for the benefit of inhabitants. Cosmos said to vibrate with ‘universal positive energy’ which results in all round happiness, health, wealth and prosperity for the occupants.</p>
<p class="text-center" style="color: rgb(156, 156, 156); font-size: 20px">Vaastu Shastra is also a Link to The Universe. Sun is the most important celestial body which radiates light and heat and is the foremost  reason for existence of life on earth and hence aptly called as“Soul of Universe” .The principles of vaastu shastra allow humans to use limitless energy of Sun in best possible way. The earth, which is our home planet, is like a mother and is a treasure-house for all comforts and happiness which cannot be find anywhere else.</p>

<p class="text-center" style="color: rgb(156, 156, 156); font-size: 20px">We realise that people are besieged with doubts and have unwarranted fears because there is so much confusion and not much clarity .Besides people who read about Vaastu Shastra and superstitious fear envelopes as nearly all sites talk about the ill-effects that one will incur if the house is not in accordance with Vaastu Principle there are people who don’t even realize that the problems they are facing could be due to  wrong Vaastu. If we study Vaastu properly then we find that these principles have the scientific reasoning. If we study Vaastu properly then we find that these principles have the scientific reasoning. These principles are to be followed for change in destiny for  betterment. Guidelines of vaastu shastra enables human to yield best results inspired by mother nature.</p>

<p class="text-center" style="color: rgb(156, 156, 156); font-size: 20px">We, spend most of our time inside a building be it our home, office or anything else. It’s also a fact that everything in the universe have a level of energy associated with them. Vaastu eliminates the negativity and enhances positive energies around us. Hence it’s right to say that all buildings and even the land on which a building is erected has vibrations of energy associated with it.</p>
<p class="text-center" style="color: rgb(156, 156, 156); font-size: 20px">Some energies are positive while others are negative .
Vaastu Shastra lays down some principles which were originally carefully guarded and meant for only temples, palaces and for the elite. However, these principles gradually spread by word of mouth as set, rigid rules and were used for houses as well. The ancient Rishis who formulated Vaastu Shastra, in all their wisdom knew that unless they enforced the principles of planning very strictly, people won’t be able build structures which will be not be auspicious for their inhabitants. Perhaps to prevent such a situation, the principles of Vaastu Shastra were made hard and fast rules. </p>
<p class="text-center" style="color: rgb(156, 156, 156); font-size: 20px">Guidelines of vaastu shastra enables human to draw on all-embracing role of mother earth for best results.
Vaastu is  derived from the sanskrit word ‘vasathi’ which means ‘comfort’ and its literal meaning is a dwelling place derived from the root ‘vas’ which means ‘to live’ or ‘to reside’. Vaastu is a broad term that also includes Bhoomi , Prasad,Yaana,and Shayana whereas Shastra is the sanskrit word for ‘science’ and stands for the principles and guidelines .Therefore, Vaastu shastra is the science of arranging the above-mentioned elements in their respective places so that they are in harmony, which in turn will make the lives of the inmates happy and peaceful.
The fundamental principle of Vastu Shastra is to add ‘Value to the Life of the man’ staying in a building by bringing about harmony between the inmate, nature and the built environment. Essentially, Vastu Shastra aims to eliminate negative energy and enhance positive energy present at a place or location so that a person, family or even business inhabiting a building become prosperous and progressive.</p>
<p class="text-center" style="color: rgb(156, 156, 156); font-size: 20px">Vastu Shastra has evolved over centuries and from experience it has been documented that the improper positioning of rooms with respect to the surrounding elements causes an imbalance and when the harmonics between elements gets disturbed, the energies in the inmates get dissipated in different directions leading to stress, tension and ill-health. The thinking and action of people inhabiting or working in these buildings also get affected adversely. </p>
<p class="text-center" style="color: rgb(156, 156, 156); font-size: 20px">But we all know that, it is not always possible to rigidly follow all the guidelines because of various limitations. So, we should apply the principles based on science behind these principles to live a peaceful life.</p>
